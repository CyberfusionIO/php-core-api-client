# Cyberfusion Core PHP API client

PHP client for the [Cyberfusion Core API](https://core-api.cyberfusion.io/).

This client was built for and tested on the **1.239.0** version of the API.

## Support

This client is officially supported by Cyberfusion.

Have questions? Ask your support questions on the [platform](https://platform.cyberfusion.io/). No access to the platform? Send an email to [support@cyberfusion.io](mailto:support@cyberfusion.io). **GitHub issues are not actively monitored.**

## Author

This client was developed and is actively maintained by [@dvdheiden](https://github.com/dvdheiden).

The client is built upon the [Saloon package](https://docs.saloon.dev/).
Saloon provides easy-to-use functionality (sane defaults), _and_ full control (configurability).

# Install

This client can be used in any PHP project and with any framework.

This client requires PHP 8.1 or higher. It uses [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) via the [Saloon package](https://docs.saloon.dev/). The client uses specific Laravel components, but the Laravel framework is not required.

## Composer

    composer require cyberfusion/core-api-client

# Usage

## API documentation

Refer to the [API documentation](https://core-api.cyberfusion.io/) for information about API requests.

**Enums, Models, Requests and Resources** are **auto-generated** based on the OpenAPI spec - so the client is completely in line with the Core API.

## Getting started

Initialise the `CoreApiConnector` with your username and password.

The connector takes care of authentication, and offers several resources (e.g. `VirtualHosts`) and endpoints (e.g. `listVirtualHosts`).

```php
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\CoreApiConnector;

$connector = new CoreApiConnector(
    username: 'username',
    password: 'password' 
);

$virtualHosts = $connector
    ->virtualHosts()
    ->listVirtualHosts()
    ->dto();
```

## Authentication

Authenticate with the Core API using a username and password. This client takes care of authentication.

If authentication fails, `AuthenticationException` is thrown. 

Don't have an API user? Contact Cyberfusion.

## Requests

The client uses a fluent interface to build requests.

- Start with the connector
- Go to the desired resource
- Call the desired endpoint

Code example:

```php
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\CoreApiConnector;
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\Models\MailDomainCreateRequest;

$connector = new CoreApiConnector(
    username: 'username',
    password: 'password' 
);

$mailDomainResource = $connector
    ->mailDomains()
    ->createMailDomain(new MailDomainCreateRequest(
        domain: 'cyberfusion.io',
        unixUserId: 1,
        isLocal: true,
    ))
    ->dto();
```

DTOs are validated before sending the request. If invalid data is provided, `ValidationException` is thrown.

Code example:

```php
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\Models\MailAliasCreateRequest;
use Respect\Validation\Exceptions\ValidationException;

$mailAlias = new MailAliasCreateRequest(
    localPart: '&^@$#^&@$#^&',
    mailDomainId: 1
);
// throw ValidationException
```

The exception contains `ValidationError` objects in the errors collection.

Coe example:

```php
try {
    $virtualHost = $connector
        ->virtualHosts()
        ->createVirtualHost(...)
        ->dto();
} catch (RequestFailedException $exception) {
    echo $exception->getDetailMessage()->getDetail();
} catch (ValidationException $exception) {
    foreach ($exception->errors() as $error) {
        echo $error->getMsg();
    }
}
```

## Responses

API responses are mapped to DTOs: all endpoints use parameters or DTOs to send data to the API.

### Get model from response

To retrieve a model, call `dto()` on the response. This either returns:

- `Collection` of `CoreApiModel` instances
- `CoreApiModel`

Code example:

```php
$virtualHosts = $connector
    ->virtualHosts()
    ->listVirtualHosts()
    ->dto();
```

### Throw exception on failure

If a request returns an unexpected HTTP status code, `RequestFailedException` is thrown.

The exception includes the response, and - if returned - a `DetailMessage` object with more information.

### Get literal response

For advanced usage, you have full access to the literal response.

Code example:

```php
$response = $connector
    ->virtualHosts()
    ->listVirtualHosts();

if ($response->failed()) {
    echo $response->status();
}
```

See the [Responses](https://docs.saloon.dev/the-basics/responses) documentation for more information.

## Filtering/sorting data

Most endpoints support filtering and sorting data.

You can use the `Filter` and `Sort` classes to build the desired filter or sort.

Specified a field that does not exist? No error will be thrown: the filter or sort is simply not applied. You are responsible for ensuring you are working with the right object. 

Code example:

```php
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\Support\Filter;

$connector
    ->virtualHosts()
    ->listVirtualHosts(
        filter: (new Filter())->add('unix_user_id', 1),
        sort: (new Sort())->add('name', 'asc')
    );
```

## Enums

Some properties only accept certain values (enums).

Find these values in the enum classes.

### Middleware

There are several options to use middleware in the SDK. 

#### Custom middleware

The most common approach: add middleware to `CoreApiConnector`.

```php
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\CoreApiConnector;
use Saloon\Http\PendingRequest;
use Saloon\Http\Response;

$connector = new CoreApiConnector(
    .. // Initialise the connector
);

$connector
    ->middleware()
    ->onRequest(function (PendingRequest $pendingRequest) {
        // Do something with the request
    });
    
$connector
    ->middleware()    
    ->onResponse(function (Response $response) {
        // Do something with the response
    });
```

#### Guzzle Middleware

You can add middleware to the Guzzle client directly. This is useful when you want to use Guzzle-specific middleware.

```php
$connector
    ->sender()
    ->addMiddleware(
        // Add your Guzzle middleware
    );
```

Code example, when using the [request-response-log package](https://github.com/goedemiddag/request-response-log):

```php
use Goedemiddag\RequestResponseLog\RequestResponseLogger;

$connector
    ->sender()
    ->addMiddleware(
        RequestResponseLogger::middleware(Moneybird::VENDOR)
    );
```

### Manual requests

Don't want to use the full SDK, but easily send requests and retrieve responses from the Core API?

Use `ManualRequest`. Initialise the connector as usual, and send `ManualRequest` with the desired parameters:

```php
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\CoreApiConnector;
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\Support\ManualRequest;
use Saloon\Enums\Method;

$connector = new CoreApiConnector(
    .. // Initialise the connector
);
$response = $connector->send(new ManualRequest(
    url: '/api/v1/health',
    method: Method::GET, // optional: defaults to GET
    data: [], // optional: defaults to []
));
```

## Integrations

### Laravel

This client can be easily used in any Laravel application.

Add your API credentials to the `.env` file:

```
CORE_API_USERNAME=username
CORE_API_PASSWORD=password
```

Next, create a config file called `core-api.php` in the `config` directory:

```php
<?php

return [
    'username' => env('CORE_API_USERNAME'),
    'password' => env('CORE_API_PASSWORD'),
];
```

Use those files to initialise the connector:

```php
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\CoreApiConnector;

$connector = new CoreApiConnector(
    username: config('core-api.username'),
    password: config('core-api.password'),
);
```

## Helpers

The client provides several helper functions to make working with the Core API easier and to help you implement in the 
Core API in your application. 

### Certificates

In case of Certificates, the Core API requires the certificates and private key in a specific format. The client 
provides a helper to convert those to the required format.

```php
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\Support\CertificateHelper;

$rawCertificate = file_get_contents('/path/to/certificate.crt');

$formattedCertificate = CertificateHelper::format($rawCertificate);
```

The formatted certificates can be used directly in your request to the Core API:

```php
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\Support\CertificateHelper;

$connector
    ->certificates()
    ->createCertificate(new CertificateCreateRequest(
        certificate: CertificateHelper::format($rawCertificate),
        caChain: CertificateHelper::format($rawCaChain),
        privateKey: CertificateHelper::format($rawPrivateKey),
        clusterId: 1,
    ));
```

It also offers some basic functionality to validate the certificate and private key structure:

```php
use Cyberfusion\CoreApi\Support\CertificateHelper;

$isValid = CertificateHelper::isValid('-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ... -----END CERTIFICATE-----');
```
